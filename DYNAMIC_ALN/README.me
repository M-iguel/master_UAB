Using the basic the dynamic programming algorithm for aligning two sequences, implement the following enhancements:
1. Modify the current dynamic programming algorithm to allow different weights (i.e., integer score instead of unitary cost) for each alignment operation (i.e., Needleman-Wunch Algorithm). For that, modify the algorithm to consider that each insertion has a penalty of -4, each deletion has a penalty of -2, and each substitution has a different cost depending on the amino acid substituted using the BLOSUM62 matrix. Display the CIGAR in pretty format.
2. Modify the algorithm to allow free deletions at the end or beginning of the text (i.e ends-free-alignment).
3. Modify the current dynamic programming algorithm to allow transpositions of base
